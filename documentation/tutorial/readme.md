# Exosphere Tutorial

This tutorial gives an overview of the _Exopsphere_ framework,
how to build applications in it,
how these applications are structured,
how to run them.

In it we build a small Todo-list application together.
You can build the code examples along with the tutorial
to have a working Exosphere application right in front of you,
or just read without coding.

The simplicity and intuitiveness of each component within an Exosphere application
allows you to stay on top of what's going on
without the need to have working source code.

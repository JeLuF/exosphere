# Exosphere Design Goals

At Originate we specialize in building a broad variety of software solutions
in high quality at high velocity.
They consist of mobile and web frontends, cloud backends, and integrations into legacy systems,
We also operate these applications at scale,
and maintain them for many years.

Since we do this a lot,
we set out on a mission to build the framework we always wanted to have to do this.
One that makes designing, developing, and operating software solutions
as fun, efficient, elegant, and robust as it should be.
Such a framework provides support and encourages best practices
across all stacks and the full lifecycle of a project.
It helps:
* set up any code base in a modular, manageable, and reusable way
* architect and build it against explicit functional, performance, and quality specifications
* automatically deploy it into a variety of environments
* operate it at scale with built-in security and analytics
* keep the whole thing maintainable and fun to work on over time
* do all this while including product owners, testers, developers, and other stakeholders
  into an efficient, lean process with agility.

We ended up with a framework that leverages modern cloud technologies,
but goes way beyond them.
So we named it _Exosphere_,
which is the highest layer of Earth's athmosphere,
above the clouds.

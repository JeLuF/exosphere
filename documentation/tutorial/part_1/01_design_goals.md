# Exosphere Design Goals

At Originate we specialize in building a broad variety of software solutions
in high quality at high velocity.
They consist of mobile and web frontends, cloud backends, and integrations into legacy systems.
We also operate these applications at scale,
and maintain them for many years.

We found that the patterns and best practices for applications in this space
are often similar.
So we set out on a mission to build the framework we always wanted to have
for building such applications.
This framework helps maximize the efficiency of the human factor
while developing and operating large-scale software products
over long periods of time.
It does that by helping to:
* set up a new code base or extend an existing one efficiently
* build it in a modular, maintainable, reusable way
  against explicit and automatically verified
  functional, performance, security, and quality specifications
* automatically deploy it into a variety of environments
  that can be spun up and maintained easily
* operate it at scale with built-in security and analytics
* keep the whole setup maintainable and fun to work on over time
* do all this while including product owners, testers, developers, and other stakeholders
  into efficient, lean teams that work with agility

We ended up with a modular framework that leverages modern cloud technologies,
but goes way beyond them.
We named it _Exosphere_,
which is the highest layer of Earth's athmosphere,
way above the clouds.

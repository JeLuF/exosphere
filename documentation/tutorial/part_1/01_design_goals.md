# Exosphere Design Goals

At Originate we specialize in building a broad variety of software solutions
in high quality at high velocity.
They consist of mobile and web frontends, cloud backends, and integrations into legacy systems,
We also operate these applications at scale,
and maintain them for many years.

The emerging patterns and best practices for such applications are often the same.
So we set out on a mission to build the framework we always wanted to have that supports us.
This framework helps:
* set up any code base in a modular, manageable, and reusable way
* build it against explicit functional, performance, and quality specifications that are constantly verified
* automatically deploy it into a variety of environments that can be spun up easily
* operate it at scale with built-in security and analytics
* keep the whole thing maintainable and fun to work on over time
* do all this while including product owners, testers, developers, and other stakeholders
  into efficient, lean teams that work with agility.

We ended up with a framework that leverages modern cloud technologies,
but goes way beyond them.
So we named it _Exosphere_,
which is the highest layer of Earth's athmosphere,
above the clouds.

# Exosphere Architecture

Exophere consists of an open-source developer SDK and a massively scalable cloud runtime.


## Developer SDK

The Developer SDK is open source
and allows to develop Exosphere applications on Windows, OS X, and Linux computers.

It consists of a command-line tool that scaffolds, tests,
runs, and deploys Exosphere code bases.

The SDK can also be used to run them in on your own production infrastructure.


## Cloud runtime

The Exosphere Cloud Runtime is operated by Originate
and provides professional, cost-efficient hosting of Exosphere apps.
